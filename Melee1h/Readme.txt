Adds one handed variants of the vanilla melee weapons to the game:
Sword1h
Sword1hequal   -- As much damage as the vanilla fireaxe
Sword1hvorpal  -- 1000 damage on light attacks, 2000 on heavy
WoodAxe1h
FirefighterAxe1h
BaseballBat1h
NailedBaseballBat1h
BarbedBaseballBat1h

Damage and reach is unchanged, though it appears the 1h animations don´t have quite as much reach as the 2h animations so there might be a slight loss of reach in practice.
I made this because I get nauseous jogging with a 2h weapon in game and wanted to try them out.

For types.xml, simply change the vanilla names in your types.xml to the ones above.

Thanks to Tree from Enfusion Modders Discord for pointing me in the right direction to get this working. I still don´t know why it works, but it does.
You are free to re-use and repack this, it´s all open source, do whatever you want.
